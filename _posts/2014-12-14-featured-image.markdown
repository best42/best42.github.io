### 3 simple tips to make you sleep!!!

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>leep .</p>

#### 1. Do exercise

If you are has enough exercise (do exercise around 1 hour per day), However the word exercise that I mention should be a proper exercise like running or playing sport. Those activities will make you tide and sleep well

#### 2. Don't take a nap in during the day

This is a very important tip because if you sleep during the daytime it will definitely make you awake at night. If you know yourself that you are sleepy then do somthings or find some work to do. NEVER Fall Asleep!!!!

#### 3. Find your own way of sleep(action or food or drink)

There is several way to make you sleep like drink warm milk or water before go to bed. However, it depend on each person personality of going to sleep. For myself if I read a book, then I will be sleepy so reading a book is a good method for me to sleep.
